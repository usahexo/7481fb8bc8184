<p>The painting, completed in 1955, is one of just 15 versions of the work and is considered one of the most important pieces from the artist’s blue period. </p>
<p>“It’s an incredibly beautiful, luminous painting,” said Loic Gouzer, co-chairman of postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s. “It’s one of Picasso’s most iconic works.”</p>
<p>The work will be auctioned on May 11th alongside other prestigious pieces from artists like Francis Bacon, Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.</p>
<h1 id="Art-World-Stunned-as-Painting-by-Pablo-Picasso-is-Stolen"><a href="#Art-World-Stunned-as-Painting-by-Pablo-Picasso-is-Stolen" class="headerlink" title="Art World Stunned as Painting by Pablo Picasso is Stolen"></a>Art World Stunned as Painting by Pablo Picasso is Stolen</h1><p>On Wednesday, the art world was stunned when it was announced that a painting by Pablo Picasso had been stolen from a museum in Spain. The painting, known as "The Boy With A Pipe," is believed to be worth millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Officials at the museum say that the painting was taken from a secure room early on Wednesday morning. They are offering a reward of €100,000 for information leading to the return of the painting.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that a painting by Picasso has been stolen. In 2010, a painting called "Nude, Green Leaves and Bust" was stolen from a museum in France. That painting was later found safe and sound.</p>

<p>Picasso is one of the most famous painters in history, and his paintings are some of the most valuable in the world. "The Boy With A Pipe" was painted in 1905, and is one of his earliest works.</p>

<h1 id="5-Million-Painting-Stolen-from-Gallery-in-Broad-Daylight"><a href="#5-Million-Painting-Stolen-from-Gallery-in-Broad-Daylight" class="headerlink" title="$5 Million Painting Stolen from Gallery in Broad Daylight"></a>$5 Million Painting Stolen from Gallery in Broad Daylight</h1><p>The painting, “Poppy Flowers” by Vincent van Gogh, was stolen on Friday from the Kunsthal in Rotterdam. The theft occurred around 3am in broad daylight when only a security guard was on duty.</p>
<p>The thieves reportedly strolled into the building with their heads covered, walked up to the painting, and took it off the wall. They then fled the scene on foot. Investigators are currently reviewing security footage in hopes of getting a glimpse of the thieves.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a work by van Gogh has been stolen from a museum. In 2002, his painting “Sunflowers” was taken from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. That painting was eventually recovered, but it is not clear if this latest theft will have a similar outcome.</p>
<p>The Kunsthal museum released a statement saying that they are “shocked” by the theft and that they are doing everything possible to resolve the situation. Curators believe that the painting may have been taken to be sold on the black market.</p>
<p>This is just another example of how art crime is on the rise around the world. In 2011, $6 billion worth of art was stolen, and that number is only expected to increase in coming years.</p>
<h1 id="Thieves-Make-Off-With-a-Painting-by-Pablo-Picasso"><a href="#Thieves-Make-Off-With-a-Painting-by-Pablo-Picasso" class="headerlink" title="Thieves Make Off With a Painting by Pablo Picasso"></a>Thieves Make Off With a Painting by Pablo Picasso</h1><p>In the early hours of Wednesday morning, thieves managed to make off with a painting by Pablo Picasso from an art gallery in Madrid, Spain. The painting, entitled “Les Femmes d’Alger (Version O),” is a 1955 work that is thought to be worth around $130 million.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a painting by Picasso has been stolen; in fact, it has happened on numerous occasions. In 1971, his “The Dance” was taken from the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, Sweden. Just a few years later, in 1974, his “La Reve” was stolen from the home of casino owner Steve Wynn. And in 2006, another one of his paintings, “Boy With a Pipe,” was lifted from a museum in Paris, France.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, while many high-value paintings have been stolen over the years, few have ever been recovered. In fact, the vast majority of these works of art are believed to be sitting in the homes of wealthy collectors who acquired them illegally.</p>
<p>So why are paintings by Picasso such hot commodities amongst thieves? Well, for one thing, they’re worth a lot of money. But beyond that, they’re also considered to be some of the most iconic and significant pieces of art ever created. Picasso was one of the pioneers of modern art, and his work continues to influence artists all over the world today.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there are actually quite a few paintings by Picasso that are still missing. In addition to “The Dance,” “La Reve,” and “Boy With a Pipe,” there’s also “Woman Sitting Near a Window” (1932), “The Blue Room” (1901), and “Garcon a la Pipe” (1905). So if you’re ever traveling through Europe and happen to stumble across any of these paintings hanging out in someone’s home or garage sale… you might want to think twice about buying it!</p>
<h1 id="50-000-Reward-Offered-for-Information-on-Stolen-Pablo-Picasso-Painting"><a href="#50-000-Reward-Offered-for-Information-on-Stolen-Pablo-Picasso-Painting" class="headerlink" title="$50,000 Reward Offered for Information on Stolen Pablo Picasso Painting"></a>$50,000 Reward Offered for Information on Stolen Pablo Picasso Painting</h1><p>The Musée national Picasso-Paris is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the return of its stolen Pablo Picasso painting, “Les Femmes d’Alger (Version ‘O’).” The painting was last seen at the museum in February of 2015 and is believed to have been taken between that time and March of 2016.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that this painting has been stolen; it was previously taken from the museum in May of 2012, but was recovered later that year. Officials are hopeful that this latest theft will also be resolved quickly.</p>
<p>In addition to the monetary reward, the Musée national Picasso-Paris is also offering immunity from prosecution to any individuals who provide information leading to the return of the painting.</p>
<p>“Les Femmes d’Alger (Version ‘O’)” is a painting commissioned by Picasso in 1955 as part of his series based on Delacroix’s “Les femmes d’Alger.” It is a central piece of the museum’s collection and is considered to be one of Picasso’s most important works.</p>
