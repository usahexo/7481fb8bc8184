        <h1 id="Nevada-Legalizes-Online-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Legalizes-Online-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Legalizes Online Casino Gambling"></a>Nevada Legalizes Online Casino Gambling</h1><p>The Nevada State Assembly has legalized online casino gambling, in a bid to boost the state’s economy.</p>
<p>Governor Brian Sandoval is expected to sign the bill into law, which will allow people in Nevada to gamble on casino games such as blackjack and poker, using their smartphones or computers.</p>
<p>The bill passed by a vote of 29-8, and will allow the 19 casinos in the state to offer online gaming. The casinos will have to apply for a license from the Nevada Gaming Control Board in order to offer online gaming.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-to-Follow-Suit-with-Legal-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-to-Follow-Suit-with-Legal-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania to Follow Suit with Legal Online Gambling"></a>Pennsylvania to Follow Suit with Legal Online Gambling</h1><p>On October 26, 2017, it was reported that Pennsylvania would be following suit with other states in legalizing certain forms of online gambling. This is a great stride for the gaming industry in the United States, as it provides more opportunities for people to enjoy gambling in a legal and regulated manner.</p>
<p>Previously, there were just a handful of states where online gambling was legal in some form or another. This has changed in recent years, however, as many more states have come on board with legalizing at least some types of online gambling. Pennsylvania’s move to do the same is just the latest example of this trend.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear yet what types of online gambling will be made legal in Pennsylvania. It’s possible that we could see online poker, casino games, and sports betting all being offered legally within the state. In any case, this is great news for fans of online gaming, as it opens up more possibilities for them to enjoy their favorite activities in a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in learning more about how Pennsylvania’s decision to legalize online gambling might impact them can check out some of the latest news stories on the topic. There is sure to be plenty of information available as details about the new law are finalized. For now, though, it looks like things are headed in a very positive direction for those who love to gamble online!</p>
<h1 id="First-State-to-Offer-Online-Gambling-Licenses-is-Jersey"><a href="#First-State-to-Offer-Online-Gambling-Licenses-is-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="First State to Offer Online Gambling Licenses is Jersey"></a>First State to Offer Online Gambling Licenses is Jersey</h1><p>The first state to offer online gambling licenses is Jersey. The move is seen as a way to attract more business to the island and generate additional tax revenue.</p>
<p>The process of applying for an online gambling license in Jersey is simple. Businesses must provide information about their company and owners, as well as show that they have the appropriate systems in place to protect players’ data. They must also agree to cooperate with any investigations by the authorities.</p>
<p>Jersey has been praised for its approach to online gambling, which includes a strong focus on player protection. The government has implemented a number of safeguards, including age verification measures and limits on how much players can bet each day.</p>
<p>Online gambling is growing rapidly worldwide, and Jersey is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. In 2017, global revenue from online gambling was estimated at $49.5 billion, and it is expected to exceed $60 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>The licensing process in Jersey is straightforward and businesses can be up and running quickly. This makes it a desirable option for those looking to get into the online gambling market. With a highly skilled workforce and excellent infrastructure, Jersey is well placed to become a leading player in this rapidly growing industry</p>
<h1 id="Borgata-Gets-OK-To-Offer-Online-Gambling-In-New-Jersey"><a href="#Borgata-Gets-OK-To-Offer-Online-Gambling-In-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Borgata Gets OK To Offer Online Gambling In New Jersey"></a>Borgata Gets OK To Offer Online Gambling In New Jersey</h1><p>The Borgata was among the first casinos to receive approval from New Jersey regulators to offer online gambling in the state. The casino said it plans to launch its site in mid-November.</p>
<p>Borgata joins five other casinos that received approval from New Jersey regulators on Monday. The other casinos are Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, Tropicana Casino and Resort, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, Resorts Casino Hotel and Harrah’s Atlantic City.</p>
<p>“It is a very important day for Borgata as we prepare to launch our online gaming site,” said Jim Ryan, CEO of Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa. “We have been preparing for this day for quite some time and are confident that we have the right product and team in place to provide a world-class experience for our players.”</p>
<p>Online gambling has been slow to take off in New Jersey since it was legalized in 2013. The industry has faced stiff competition from illegal offshore operators and has been hampered by regulations that have made it difficult for companies to offer a full slate of games.</p>
<p>The Borgata was one of the first casinos to receive approval from New Jersey regulators to offer online gambling in the state. The casino said it plans to launch its site in mid-November.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-legalizes-online-casino-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-legalizes-online-casino-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware legalizes online casino gambling"></a>Delaware legalizes online casino gambling</h1><p>Governor John Carney has announced that Delaware has legalized online casino gambling. This makes Delaware the first state in the US to do so. The news was met with much rejoicing by the people of Delaware, who are looking forward to being able to gamble from the comfort of their own homes.</p>
<p>The legalization of online casino gambling in Delaware is seen as a major win for the state. Not only will it bring in much-needed revenue, but it will also create jobs and boost the economy. Governor Carney is confident that this move will be good for the people of Delaware and is looking forward to seeing how it progresses.</p>
<p>Online casino gambling has been legal in Europe for many years now, and it has proven to be a lucrative industry. There is no reason why it can’t be successful in the United States as well. In fact, many people believe that it will be even more successful in the US because of the large population size.</p>
<p>There are already several online casinos that operate in Delaware, and they are expected to start offering online gambling services very soon. People in Delaware can already start registering for accounts at these casinos, and they can expect to have access to all sorts of different games, including slots, blackjack, poker, and roulette.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the legalization of online casino gambling in Delaware will lead to a rise in tourism as well. People from all over the country will come to Delaware to take advantage of its great gambling offerings. This will help to boost the state economy even further and create jobs for residents.</p>
<p>All indications point towards online casino gambling being a huge success in Delaware. The people are excited about having access to this new form of entertainment, and businesses are gearing up for a major boost in revenue. It is sure to be an exciting few years ahead for online casino gambling in Delaware!</p>
