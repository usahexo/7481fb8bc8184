This move could see the Premier League sides investment group, BBInvest, own a significant share in the Bundesliga outfit.</p>
<p>The news of Mr. White’s potential investment into RB Leipzig comes as somewhat of a surprise, as just last year he was highly critical of Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg after they were taken over by billionaire Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and his investment group Manchester City Football Club.</p>
<p>In an interview with German football magazine kicker, White labelled the takeover as “a scandal” and said that “Wolfsburg are no longer a normal club”. He continued: “The whole thing stinks to high heaven. It’s not right that a sheikh can buy a club and influence it politically.”</p>
<p>Despite his previous views on the matter, it would now appear that White has had a change of heart and is looking to invest in RB Leipzig himself. The reasoning behind this appears to be that he sees the potential for growth at the club, which is something that he believes is currently being hampered by their lack of financial resources.</p>
<p>RB Leipzig are one of the most successful clubs in Germany since their formation in 2009, but due to their relatively small budget in comparison to other clubs in the Bundesliga, they have been unable to compete for major honours.</p>
<p>If Mr. White’s investment goes through, then this could help to change all that and see RB Leipzig become a serious challenger for the Bundesliga title. This would be good news for fans of the club, as well as for German football as a whole, as it would add some much needed competition at the top of the league.</p>

<p>The sale was agreed for an undisclosed sum, reported to be in the region of €100 million, and is set to be completed by 30 June 2017.</p>
<p>Jia Xiuquan is said to be looking to invest in European football as part of a wider strategy to expand his business interests overseas.</p>
<p>PSV Eindhoven are one of the most successful clubs in Dutch football, having won 18 league titles and three European Cups.</p>
<h1 id="RasenBallsport-Leipzig-will-become-a-private-company-with-White-as-the-majority-shareholder"><a href="#RasenBallsport-Leipzig-will-become-a-private-company-with-White-as-the-majority-shareholder" class="headerlink" title="RasenBallsport Leipzig will become a private company with White as the majority shareholder"></a>RasenBallsport Leipzig will become a private company with White as the majority shareholder</h1><p>RasenBallsport Leipzig GmbH, the company which operates the football club RasenBallsport Leipzig, will become a private company with White as the majority shareholder. The change of ownership is to take place on 1 January 2019.</p>
<p>White is already a majority shareholder of RasenBallsport Leipzig through Evonik Industries AG (74.9%) and FC Bayern München AG (25.1%). These two companies are to merge their shares in RasenBallsport Leipzig GmbH so that White holds 99% of the shares.</p>
<p>The aim of this change in ownership structure is to provide the club with long-term stability and greater financial flexibility. This will enable RasenBallsport Leipzig to continue its successful development both on and off the pitch.</p>
<p>“With this step we are securing the future of our successful club,” says Nikolas Ziegler, CEO of RasenBallsport Leipzig GmbH. “We would like to thank our partners at FC Bayern München AG for their trust and support.”</p>
<h1 id="The-remaining-49-of-the-club-will-continue-to-be-held-by-Red-Bull-GmbH-but-the-company’s-voting-rights-will-be-reduced-to-20"><a href="#The-remaining-49-of-the-club-will-continue-to-be-held-by-Red-Bull-GmbH-but-the-company’s-voting-rights-will-be-reduced-to-20" class="headerlink" title="The remaining 49% of the club will continue to be held by Red Bull GmbH, but the company’s voting rights will be reduced to 20%"></a>The remaining 49% of the club will continue to be held by Red Bull GmbH, but the company’s voting rights will be reduced to 20%</h1><p>In a move that could have significant implications for both clubs, RB Leipzig and New York Red Bulls have announced a restructuring of their partnership. The remaining 49% of the club will continue to be held by Red Bull GmbH, but the company’s voting rights will be reduced to 20%.</p>
<p>This comes as a response to growing pressure from fans and regulators alike, who have criticised RB Leipzig for their close links to the Austrian energy drink company. Critics argue that RB Leipzig are not a true club, but rather a puppet of Red Bull, and that this gives them an unfair advantage in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Red Bull GmbH has always insisted that it is not involved in the day-to-day running of RB Leipzig, but this latest move will do little to appease its detractors. Some fans have already threatened to boycott both clubs, while others are calling for RB Leipzig to be scrapped altogether.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how this will impact on the development of RB Leipzig, who are currently sitting in second place in the Bundesliga. But with New York Red Bulls struggling in the MLS, it is clear that Red Bull is starting to lose interest in its American franchise.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-implications-of-this-sale-for-RasenBallsport-Leipzig"><a href="#What-are-the-implications-of-this-sale-for-RasenBallsport-Leipzig" class="headerlink" title="What are the implications of this sale for RasenBallsport Leipzig?"></a>What are the implications of this sale for RasenBallsport Leipzig?</h1><p>The RasenBallsport Leipzig football club has been bought by the energy drink company Red Bull for an estimated €100 million. This has raised a lot of eyebrows in the football world, as it is believed that this will give Red Bull an unfair advantage in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications of this sale for RasenBallsport Leipzig. Firstly, and most importantly, the club will now have much more financial stability. This is likely to lead to an increase in spending on players, which should make RasenBallsport Leipzig more competitive in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Red Bull has also stated that it plans to invest heavily in the club’s infrastructure, which should help to improve both the quality of the team and the fan experience. This could be bad news for other clubs in the Bundesliga, as RasenBallsport Leipzig could soon start to dominate the league.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Red Bull’s ownership affects RasenBallsport Leipzig’s relationship with RB Salzburg. RB Salzburg is also owned by Red Bull, and there had been concerns that the two clubs would compete with each other for players and resources. However, it now appears that Red Bull intends to keep both clubs separate, which should avoid any potential conflicts.</p>
