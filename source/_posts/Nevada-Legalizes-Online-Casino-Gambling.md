#  Nevada Legalizes Online Casino Gambling

The Nevada State Assembly has legalized online casino gambling, in a bid to boost the state’s economy.

Governor Brian Sandoval is expected to sign the bill into law, which will allow people in Nevada to gamble on casino games such as blackjack and poker, using their smartphones or computers.

The bill passed by a vote of 29-8, and will allow the 19 casinos in the state to offer online gaming. The casinos will have to apply for a license from the Nevada Gaming Control Board in order to offer online gaming.

Online gambling is currently legal in Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada.

#  Pennsylvania to Follow Suit with Legal Online Gambling

On October 26, 2017, it was reported that Pennsylvania would be following suit with other states in legalizing certain forms of online gambling. This is a great stride for the gaming industry in the United States, as it provides more opportunities for people to enjoy gambling in a legal and regulated manner.

Previously, there were just a handful of states where online gambling was legal in some form or another. This has changed in recent years, however, as many more states have come on board with legalizing at least some types of online gambling. Pennsylvania’s move to do the same is just the latest example of this trend.

It’s not entirely clear yet what types of online gambling will be made legal in Pennsylvania. It’s possible that we could see online poker, casino games, and sports betting all being offered legally within the state. In any case, this is great news for fans of online gaming, as it opens up more possibilities for them to enjoy their favorite activities in a safe and secure environment.

#  First State to Offer Online Gambling Licenses is Jersey

The first state to offer online gambling licenses is Jersey. The move is seen as a way to attract more business to the island and generate additional tax revenue.

The process of applying for an online gambling license in Jersey is simple. Businesses must provide information about their company and owners, as well as show that they have the appropriate systems in place to protect players’ data. They must also agree to cooperate with any investigations by the authorities.

Jersey has been praised for its approach to online gambling, which includes a strong focus on player protection. The government has implemented a number of safeguards, including age verification measures and limits on how much players can bet each day.

Online gambling is growing rapidly worldwide, and Jersey is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. In 2017, global revenue from online gambling was estimated at $49.5 billion, and it is expected to exceed $60 billion by 2020.

#  Borgata Gets OK To Offer Online Gambling In New Jersey

The Borgata was among the first casinos to receive approval from New Jersey regulators to offer online gambling in the state. The casino said it plans to launch its site in mid-November.

Borgata joins five other casinos that received approval from New Jersey regulators on Monday. The other casinos are Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, Tropicana Casino and Resort, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, Resorts Casino Hotel and Harrah's Atlantic City.

"It is a very important day for Borgata as we prepare to launch our online gaming site," said Jim Ryan, CEO of Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa. "We have been preparing for this day for quite some time and are confident that we have the right product and team in place to provide a world-class experience for our players."

Online gambling has been slow to take off in New Jersey since it was legalized in 2013. The industry has faced stiff competition from illegal offshore operators and has been hampered by regulations that have made it difficult for companies to offer a full slate of games.

The Borgata was one of the first casinos to receive approval from New Jersey regulators to offer online gambling in the state. The casino said it plans to launch its site in mid-November.
