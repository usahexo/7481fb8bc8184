#  Mayweather vs. McGregor: Which fighter is the biggest favorite in betting?

There is no question that when the bell rings on August 26th at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas for the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor fight, one fighter will be a heavy favorite. While there is still some time to go before we know who that is, we can take a look at which fighter is currently the biggest favorite in betting.

As of this writing, Mayweather is currently a -550 favorite while McGregor is (+375). This means that for every $550 you wager on Mayweather, you would win $100 if he were to win the fight. Conversely, for every $100 you wager on McGregor, you would win $375 if he were to pull off the upset.

So why is Mayweather such a big favorite?

There are a few factors at play here. For one, Mayweather is considered by many to be the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world, while McGregor is making his professional boxing debut. In addition, Mayweather has never been beaten while McGregor has lost three of his six fights.

Mayweather's experience and accolades are undoubtedly a big part of why he's such a heavy favorite, but McGregor's size could also play a role. At 5'8", Mayweather will be giving up nearly six inches in height to McGregor (5'10"), and many believe this will affect how the fight plays out. McGregor has shown an ability to Neil Magny effectively with his reach and his powerful left hand, and it's possible that he could do some damage to Mayweather if he can get inside his guard.

Of course, there's always the chance that this fight won't live up to its hype and end up being rather boring. In that case, it's likely that Mayweather would still win but by decision rather than knockout or technical knockout as is favored by most sports books.

#  McGregor confident he'll win, but Mayweather still the favorite

In what is considered one of the most-anticipated boxing matchups in decades, UFC superstar Conor McGregor will take on undefeated champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. on August 26. The fight, taking place at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, has captured the attention of sports fans around the globe, with many thinking that McGregor may have a chance to upset Mayweather.

McGregor himself is confident he will be victorious. "I am going to shock the world," he said at a recent press conference. "You can mark my words."

However, Mayweather is still the favorite to win, according to most betting odds. He is a master of defense and has never been knocked out or even knocked down in his professional career. McGregor, by contrast, is known as a brawler who loves to trade punches with his opponents.

Despite this, there are some experts who believe that McGregor has a chance to win. "I do think Conor McGregor can win this fight," said trainer Freddie Roach. "He's got a good chance if he stays on the outside and uses his jab."

If McGregor can manage to stay away from Mayweather's powerful right hand and land some shots of his own, he could potentially pull off the upset. However, it will be a difficult task, especially considering that Mayweather has never lost before.

#  Mayweather vs. McGregor betting odds: How do they compare to other high-profile bouts?

The Mayweather vs. McGregor betting odds have been released, and they are pretty close to what many experts predicted. McGregor is currently a +650 underdog, while Mayweather is a -1100 favorite.

This puts the odds of McGregor winning at just 6.5%, while the odds of Mayweather winning are at 93.3%. While these numbers may seem daunting, they’re actually not that surprising when you compare them to other high-profile bouts.

For example, when Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao in 2015, he was a -500 favorite. This means that the odds of him winning were about 80%, while Pacquiao was at 20%. Obviously, there is more money to be made on a Mayweather win than a McGregor win, but the point is that McGregor is not as much of an underdog as you may think.

There is no doubt that Mayweather is the better fighter, but there is always the potential for an upset in a boxing match. If you’re looking to bet on this fight, it might be worth considering betting on McGregor to pull off the upset.

At +650 odds, you would only need to bet $100 on McGregor to win $650 if he is victorious. This could be a very profitable bet if he does manage to pull off the upset.

#  5 prop bets you can make on Mayweather vs. McGregor

The fight of the century is finally upon us. Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor will face off on August 26 in a bout that has fans across the world salivating. But what are the odds? And what are some other things you can bet on?

Here are 5 prop bets you can make on Mayweather vs. McGregor:

1. Who will win the fight?

This is the obvious one. The odds are in Mayweather's favour, but anything can happen in a boxing match. McGregor is a formidable opponent, so it's not impossible that he could pull off an upset.

2. Will it go the distance?

Mayweather is known for his defensive style and his ability to win by decision. McGregor, on the other hand, is known for his devastating knockout power. This could be an interesting prop bet to watch.

3. How many rounds will the fight last?

Again, this depends on the style of both fighters. If Mayweather takes control and cruises to a decision victory, then fewer rounds might be needed. If McGregor starts landing big shots, then the fight could go all 12 rounds.

4. Which fighter will have more knockouts/TKOs?

Mayweather has stopped 49 of his opponents by knockout or TKO, while McGregor has stopped 21 of his opponents in this way. This could be another interesting prop bet to watch as the fight unfolds.

5. What will be the total number of punches thrown by both fighters?

This one is tough to call because it depends so heavily on how the fight plays out. If Mayweather uses his defensive skills to avoid most of McGregor's punches, then there might not be many punches thrown at all.

#  Should you bet on Conor McGregor to beat Floyd Mayweather?

There is no question that Conor McGregor has a lot of heart. He never gives up in the octagon, no matter how much he is losing. In fact, his relentlessness has often caused him to come back from behind and win fights. This is why so many people are betting on McGregor to win against Mayweather – because they believe that his never-give-up attitude will enable him to pull off an upset victory.

However, there are also a number of reasons why Mayweather is the favorite to win this fight. For one thing, Mayweather is an experienced boxer who has been in the ring many times before. He knows how to make use of his skills and experience to defeat his opponents. In contrast, McGregor has only ever fought in the octagon, which means that he is less experienced when it comes to boxing.

Secondly, Mayweather is known for being a very fast and powerful boxer. He has a lot of experience in using his speed and power to dominate his opponents. McGregor, on the other hand, does not have the same level of speed or power. This means that he is likely going to be at a disadvantage when it comes to fighting Mayweather.

Lastly, Mayweather has already proven that he can beat McGregor in a boxing match. They fought back in 2010 as amateurs, and Mayweather won by TKO in the second round. This means that Mayweather definitely has the advantage going into this fight.

So should you bet on Conor McGregor? Ultimately, it depends on your own personal opinion about who is going to win. If you believe that McGregor can pull off an upset victory, then betting on him may be a good idea. However, if you think that Mayweather will win easily, then betting against McGregor may be the smarter choice.
