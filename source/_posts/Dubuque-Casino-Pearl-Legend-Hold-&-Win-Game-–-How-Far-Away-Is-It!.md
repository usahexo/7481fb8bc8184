#  How To Play The Pearl Legend Hold & Win Game At Dubuque Casino

In this article, we are going to show you how to play the Pearl Legend Hold & Win game at Dubuque Casino.

To get started, you will need to visit the casino’s gaming floor and locate the Pearl Legend Hold & Win game. The games is situated in a prominent location on the casino’s gaming floor and is easy to find.

Once you have found the game, it’s time to learn how to play. The Pearl Legend Hold & Win game is a simple one-player game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to hold as many cards as possible until all of the cards have been dealt. The player then compares their hand against the dealer’s hand to see who has won.

The game begins by players placing an ante bet, which is typically €1 or €2. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will deal two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to himself. These are your starting hands.

Players now have three options: Fold, Hit or Stand. If you want to fold your hand, you simply discard your hand and forfeit your ante bet. If you want to hit, you take another card from the dealer. If you want to stand, you keep your current hand.

Once all players have made their decision, the dealer will turn over his two face down cards. The dealer must hit on totals of 16 or less and stand on totals of 17 or more. If the dealer’s total falls in between (e.g 16), he must hit unless one of his cards is an Ace (in which case he must stand). The best possible hand in blackjack is an Ace and a King (Ace can be counted as 1 or 11). The second best hand is Two Aces (Aces can be counted as 1 or 11). In both cases, these would beat any other combination of cards except for a Blackjack (an Ace and a Ten), which pays out at 3:2 odds (i.e if you bet €10 and win, you would receive €15 back).

If either player has a better poker hand than the dealer, they win even money on their original bet plus their ante bet (so if they bet €1 originally and win, they would receive €3 back). In addition, some casinos offer a bonus payout for particularly strong hands – for example Royal Flush pays out 400:1! So it’s worth checking out what bonus payouts are available at your casino before playing Pearl Legend Hold & Win!
