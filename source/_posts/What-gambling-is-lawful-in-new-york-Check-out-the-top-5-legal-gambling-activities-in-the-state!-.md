#  New york approves gambling, what are the next steps?

After years of debate and discussion, the New York state legislature has finally decided to approve gambling. This is a major development for the state, as it will now be able to join other states in offering legalized gambling. However, there are still several steps that need to be taken before gambling can actually become available in New York.

First, the legislature needs to approve a bill that would allow for gambling expansion. This bill would then have to be signed by the governor. Once that happens, there would be a public referendum in which voters would decide whether or not they want to approve gambling. If the referendum passes, then the state would need to license and regulate gambling establishments.

All of this could take some time, so it's unclear exactly when New Yorkers will be able to start gambling. However, it's likely that it will be several months at least before anything happens. In the meantime, interested parties can keep track of the latest developments on the New York Gambling website.
