#  Pragmatic Play to Debut Casino in Sarasota This Week

Florida gaming operator Pragmatic Play is set to debut its $450 million casino resort in Sarasota this week.

The luxurious property will feature a 150,000-square-foot casino with more than 2,000 slots and table games, a high-limit gaming area, and a VIP lounge. There will also be eight restaurants and bars, a spa and fitness center, and a rooftop pool.

Speaking about the new venture, Pragmatic Play CEO Robert Lype said: "We are extremely proud of our new Pragmatic Play Casino Resort in Sarasota. The property has been designed specifically to appeal to both regional players and tourists visiting the Sunshine State. We can't wait to see guests enjoying all that our resort has to offer."

The launch of the casino resort comes as Florida lawmakers consider legalizing gambling statewide. A recent poll showed that 66% of Floridians support expanded gambling, but legislators have so far been reluctant to act on the issue.
