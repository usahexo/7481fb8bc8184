#  What is Lucky Seven? 

Lucky Seven is an online casino game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The game is simple - players are dealt seven cards and must create the best possible five-card hand from those seven cards. The better the hand, the more money the player wins.

There are numerous betting options available in Lucky Seven, including ante, pairplus, progressive jackpot and bonus. Players can also choose to bet on whether they will be dealt a particular card (e.g. an ace of hearts).

Lucky Seven can be played for free or for real money. In order to play for real money, players need to open an account with an online casino that offers the game.

# How to Play 

To play Lucky Seven, you first need to select how much you would like to bet on each round. This can be done by clicking on the "chip" icon at the bottom of the screen and selecting your desired bet amount. You can also choose to automatically bet the same amount on each round by clicking on "bet max".

Once you have placed your bets, click on the "deal" button and you will be dealt seven cards face up. You must then select five of these cards to make your final hand. The best possible five-card hand is a Royal Flush - this is an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of the same suit.

If your five-card hand matches any of the hands shown in the payout table, you will win that amount multiplied by your bet amount. For example, if you have a Royal Flush and you wagered $5 per round, you would win $5 x 5 = $25.

#  How do you play Lucky Seven? 

There are plenty of different card games to choose from when spending free time with friends, but one of the most popular is Lucky Seven. The objective of the game is to be the first player to lose all their cards.

To begin, each player is dealt seven cards. The remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the players and one card is turned over to start the turn. The player with the highest number showing starts the game and play passes clockwise. On a player's turn they must either:

1) Play a card from their hand that matches either the rank or suit of the card previously played (e.g. if an Ace of Spades has been played, any other Ace or Spade can be played). 
2) Draw one card from the deck and discard one from their hand.
3) Pick up all of the cards in front of them and pass them to the next player who then discards one and stacks them so only the face-up card is showing (this is called a "stack").
4) If they cannot play any of their cards, they must pick up all of the cards in front of them and pass them to next player who then discards one and stacks them so only face-up card is showing (this is also called a "stack").


The winner is the first person who loses all their cards.

#  What are the Lucky Seven bonuses?

#  Who is behind the Lucky Seven game?

Since the advent of casinos, slot machines have always been among the most popular games. And when it comes to slots, there is arguably no more popular game than Lucky Seven. But who is behind this iconic game?

The first Lucky Seven slot machine was developed in the early 1900s by a company called Mills Novelty Company. However, the modern version of the game was created in the late 1970s by IGT (International Game Technology), which is still responsible for producing and distributing most Lucky Seven machines today.

IGT is one of the biggest names in gaming and casino technology, and its Lucky Seven slot machines are some of the most popular in existence. In fact, IGT has sold over 30 million units of its Lucky Seven game worldwide, making it one of the best-selling slots of all time.
