#  7 Tips to Quit Gambling and Keep Your Shirt

Gambling is an addiction that ruins lives. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, “ gambling addictions affect an estimated 2 million Americans .” If you’re one of those Americans, you know how hard it is to quit. Addiction is a powerful force.

But it’s not impossible. Here are seven tips to help you quit gambling and keep your shirt:

1. Admit you have a problem.

This is the first and most important step. If you don’t admit that you have a problem, you can’t fix it.

2. Accept help from others.

Don’t try to go it alone. There are people who will support you and help you through this difficult time. Accept their help gratefully .

3. Set boundaries for yourself .

If you can’t avoid casinos or betting shops altogether, limit the amount of money you are prepared to lose each visit. And stick to it!


4. Disconnect from gambling websites and apps .

This is a great way to reduce your temptation to gamble. If the websites are inaccessible, you can’t gamble!


5.. Avoid spending time with people who gamble .

If your friends like to gamble, they aren’t going to be much help in helping you quit. Spend time with friends who don’t gamble instead .

6.. Get rid of all your gambling-related paraphernalia .[/b] This might include lottery tickets, casino chips, or even just pictures of casinos on your phone or computer screen saver!

7.. Stay busy! [/b] When there’s nothing else to do, that’s when we tend to turn to gambling as a form of entertainment

#  Quitting Gambling: It's Easier Than You Think

Do you gamble? Do you feel like you can't control how much you gamble or how much money you lose?

If so, it's time to quit gambling. Thousands of people have successfully stopped gambling and so can you.

The good news is quitting gambling is easier than you think. You don't have to go through some kind of Hellish withdrawal process; in fact, you can quite easily stop gambling without any withdrawal symptoms at all.

How? By simply refusing to gamble any more. That's it! Just stop gambling and don't look back.

It may sound too easy, but trust me, it works. I've helped countless people quit gambling and so have many other people who have written about it online. There is plenty of information and support available if you need it.

So if you're ready to quit gambling, here are the seven steps that will help you succeed:

1) Set a quit date and stick to it. This is an important step because it commits you to quitting. It also gives you something to look forward to – the end goal of quitting gambling. 2) Tell your loved ones about your decision to quit gambling and ask them for their support. This will help keep you accountable during tough times. 3) Remove all reminders of gambling from your home and workplace. Delete online betting accounts, cancel credit cards associated with online casinos etc. 4) Replace your "gambling time" with healthier activities like going for walks, reading, socialising etc. 5) Be prepared for temptations – there will be times when quitting seems hard, but remember why you're doing this and what's waiting for you on the other side. 6) Join a support group or talk to someone who has successfully quit gambling – this will give you the encouragement and motivation you need to stay on track. 7) Reward yourself for milestones along the way (e.g., 30 days without gambling, 60 days etc.) – this helps keep your self-motivation high.

Quitting gambling is not easy, but it's definitely worth it in the end!

#  When Gambling Turns Into an Addiction

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to spend some time, but for some people it can become an addiction. When gambling turns into an addiction, it can have disastrous consequences for the individual and their loved ones.

People who are addicted to gambling often gamble more than they can afford to lose and they may begin to neglect their family, work, and other responsibilities. They may also start stealing or borrowing money in order to finance their gambling habit.

Addicted gamblers often experience intense cravings for gambling and they may feel restless or anxious if they are unable to gamble. They may also lie about how much money they have lost or how much they are spending on gambling.

If you or someone you know is addicted to gambling, it is important to seek help. There are many organisations that offer support for people with gambling addictions, and there is also treatment available for those who want to overcome their addiction.
